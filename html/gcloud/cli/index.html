<p><h1>Intro to the Google Cloud CLI</h1>

<p>
<b>Google Cloud CLI Documentation:</b> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud">https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud</a>

<p>
The Google Cloud CLI (<font class=ms>gcloud</font>) is used for accessing
many Google Cloud services.  (In some cases, you use another command name,
but generally they are all installed as part of the <font class=ms>gcloud</font>
package, so you don't have to install each one in turn.)

<p>
As with the AWS CLI, I recommend that you start by using the online Console,
but that you come back to learn the CLI once you have picked up the basics of
each service.
<br><a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">https://console.cloud.google.com/</a>



<p><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Most Google Cloud CLI commands are of the following form:
  <pre>
    gcloud SERVICE NOUN VERB [ARGS]</pre>
although a few are simpler:
  <pre>
    gcloud SERVICE      VERB [ARGS]</pre>

<p>
For example:
  <pre>
    gcloud app versions list </pre>
will list all of the Google App Engine versions you have installed.  (In GAE, a
"version" is a copy of the entire code for an app, that you uploaded at some
point in time; a single version can be installed on zero, one, or many
instances.  Old versions are kept around (although not served to users) until
explicitly deleted.)

<p>
Similarly:
  <pre>
    gcloud compute instance delete --zone us-west1-b foo</pre>
will delete (that is, shut down and destroy the hard drive of) the instance
<font class=ms>foo</font> inside the zone <font class=ms>us-west1-b</font>,
while
  <pre>
    gcloud compute ssh foo</pre>
will ssh to the instance <font class=ms>foo</font> (without any need to load
ssh keys onto your local machine).

<p>
This document will focus on how to install and configure the CLI; for details
about the specific commands for various servicds, read the pages in those
specific services:

<p><h2>Installing the CLI</h2>

<p><h3>Google Compute</h3>

<p>
If you've read my description of the AWS CLI, you will know that AWS installs
the <font class=ms>aws</font> tool on its standard images.  Similarly, Google
appears to install <font class=ms>gcloud</font> on its VM images.
Unsurprisingly, neither installs their competitor's CLI.  So if you need to
access one service's CLI from VMs hosted by the other, you will have to
install it yourself.

<p>
TODO: investigate if gcloud has a similar feature to the Instance Roles in AWS.  (Probably, it does.)



<p><h3>Other</h3>

<p>
As far as I can tell, the Google Cloud SDK (which is what contains
<font class=ms>gcloud</font> and the other CLI tools) is not available in the
standard package managers in any of the OSes I use.  You can add Google
repository to your list of valid repositories - and then install the package
that way - or you can download the package file, and install it by hand.  (In
fact, you even have the option of extracting a tarball into your home
directory, if you want to run <font class=ms>gcloud</font> on a machine that
you don't control!

<p><h3>Docker Image</h3>

<p>
Google provides a Docker image, which has <font class=ms>gcloud</font>
pre-installed.  Just boot it up, run <font class=ms>gcloud&nbsp;init</font>,
and you're off to the races!

<p>
    <b><font color=red>WARNING WARNING WARNING</font></b>
<br><font class=ms>gcloud&nbsp;init</font> installs credentials on your
    container.  If you save this container into a new image, do not share it
    with anyone else!

<p>
Accoring to the documentation, the correct Docker image is hosted on Google
Container Registry, here:
  <pre>
    gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk</pre>
However, Docker Hub also contains the (verified) container
  <pre>
    google/cloud-sdk</pre>
At time of writing, these two images have the same hash, so you can use either
one to download the image.

<p><h2>Configuring the CLI</h2></p>

To configure <font class=ms>gcloud</font> first install it (see above), and
then run
  <pre>
    gcloud init</pre>
The tool will walk you through an interesting and fairly straightforward
process: it will give you a link which you copy into your browser; you log in
there (and do some OAuth permission-giving), an it gives you a key to copy back
into the tool.  Answer a couple config questions, and viola!  Your machine is
configured to use <font class=ms>gcloud</font>.
