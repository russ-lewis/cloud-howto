The AWS CLI is a useful tool for accessing AWS cloud services.  As a general
rule, it can do anything that you can do through the Console (the web-based
GUI) - sometimes more!  It is useful for scripting - and of course, it's
faster (once you've learned it) than working with a GUI.

<p>
To use the CLI, you must first set it up with credentials, so that AWS knows
who you are.  If you are using a full AWS account, this process takes several
steps (Google for details if you need it).  But Vocareum has provided you with
a handy tool, which makes it pretty easy.

<p>
First, log out of your AWS Educate account (including logging out from the
Console if you are currently logged in).  Then, log in again:

<p>
Once you're logged in, look for the Account Details button:

<p><img src="img/aws_educate_account_details_button.png" border=1>

<p>
When you click on it, you'll see some information about your account.  Click
on the AWS CLI Show button:

<p><img src="img/aws_educate_cli_details_buttonShow.png" border=1>

<p>
Which will show you your CLI login details.

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Use these details soon; they change if you come back later.  (My
guess is that they are generated when you click this button, but expire if you
don't activate them soon.)

<p>
To configure the CLI, log into your EC2 instance.  First, make the .aws
directory:
  <pre>mkdir ~/.aws
  </pre>

<p>
Then, open up the credentials file (use your favorite editor).  Copy the
information that you collected above; paste it into the file.  Don't forget
to include the [default] block!

  <pre>vi ~/.aws/credentials
  </pre>

<p>
Finally, give your AWS CLI a try!  Do you have some S3 buckets defined?  If
so, then you should be able to do

  <pre>aws s3 ls
  </pre>

and see each of your buckets.  Have fun!
