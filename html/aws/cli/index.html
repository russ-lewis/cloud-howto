<p><h1>Intro to the AWS CLI</h1>

<p>
<b>AWS Documentation:</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html</a>

<p>
The AWS CLI allows you to interact with various (all?) AWS services at the
command line, making it useful both for both scripting and quick use by
experts.  However, as with most CLIs, it's a little intimidating at first;
I recommend that AWS newbies use the Console at first:

<p><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Most AWS CLI commands are of the following form:
  <pre>
    aws SERVICE OPERATION [ARGS]</pre>

<p>
For example:
  <pre>
    aws ec2 describe-instances </pre>
will give you detailed information about all currently running EC2 instances,
and
  <pre>
    aws s3 cp foo.txt s3://my-bucket-name/a/b/c/</pre>
copies the file foo.txt, from the local machine, into an S3 bucket.

<p>
This document will focus on how to install and configure the CLI; for details
about the specific commands for various servicds, read the pages in those
specific services:

    EC2: <a href="../ec2/cli.html">/aws/ec2/cli.html</a>
<br>S3: <a href="../s3/cli.html">/aws/s3/cli.html</a>

<p><h2>Installing the CLI</h2>

<p><h3>EC2</h3>

<p>
Amazon-provided AMIs (that is, EC2 machine images) typically have <font class=ms>aws</font>
pre-installed.  However, they do not generally have credentials installed; see
below for information about how to install your credentials onto the machine.

<p>
However, EC2 instances have a special power: they can be assigned Roles.  When
you create an instance, you can assign an IAM Role to the instance.  Then, when
you use the <font class=ms>aws</font> cli (even without configuring it), you
can perform whatever actions are allowed by that role.

<p>
I do <b>not</b> know exactly how this works, but based on my preliminary
investigations, it seems like some variant of the following occurs:
  <ul>
    <li> The CLI queries the <a href="../ec2/instance_metadata.html">instance metadata</a>
         to find out what role is assigned to this EC2 instance.
      <ul>
        <li>TODO: how?  Perhaps using <font class=ms>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/</font> ? </li>
        <li>TODO: can multiple roles be assigned to one instance - I think maybe so? </li>
      </ul>
    <li> The CLI queries the instance metadata, at <font class=ms>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials</font>, to get the credentials for that role </li>
    <li> The CLI provides those credentials, while it accesses the Amazon REST API, to perform some action </li>
  </ul>

<p>
<b><font color=red>WARNING WARNING WARNING</font></b>
<br>
If I understand things correctly, an assigned Role for an EC2 instance
applies to <b>any HTTP request</b> coming from the instance.  This means that
it is <b>not safe</b> to assign a Role to an instance if you plan to allow
untrusted users (or untrusted software) to run on the instance.  Unless, of
course, the Role actually represents some sort of delegated authority that
you <i>intend</i> to share with the untrusted user...



<p><h3><font class=ms>ubuntu, debian</font></h3>

Ubuntu is a variant of Debian, so the same install commands work for both:

<pre>
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install awscli
</pre>

<p>NOTE 1:
<br>The <font class=ms>sudo</font> prefix is not required if running inside a
    container.

<p>NOTE 2:
<br>Note that the <font class=ms>update</font> may not be needed, depending on
    whether or not you are in a container, and also whether or not you have
    recently updated your package listing.  However, it is relatively harmless
    to do, just in case.)



<p><h3><font class=ms>alpine</font></h3>

<pre>
  apk update
  apk add aws-cli
</pre>

<p>NOTE:
<br>This works on the <font class=ms>alpine</font> container, but I've never
    tested it on an <font class=ms>alpine</font> VM.  I would guess that a
    <font class=ms>sudo</font> prefix might be required on a VM.



<p><h3><font class=ms>fedora</font></h3>

<pre>
  yum install awscli
</pre>

<p>NOTE:
<br>This works on the <font class=ms>fedora</font> container, but I've never
    tested it on a <font class=ms>fedora</font> VM.  I would guess that a
    <font class=ms>sudo</font> prefix might be required on a VM.



<p><h3>GCE (Google Compute Engine)
       <br>Docker</h3>

<p>
For VMs (such as GCE) or Docker, see the OS-specific instructions above.



<p><h3>Docker Image</h3>

<p>
Amazon provides a Docker image, which has the <font class=ms>aws</font> tool
pre-installed.  Unlike Google <font class=ms>gcloud</font>, which gives you a
shell (so you can set up configuration, and then run multiple commands), this
Docker runs the <font class=ms>aws</font> command directly.  This means that
you must use a "bind mount" (<a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/">https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/</a>)
to map the <font class=ms>~/.aws/</font> directory on the host machine, into
the container.

<p>
You can find documentation for the container here: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/aws-cli">https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/aws-cli</a>
